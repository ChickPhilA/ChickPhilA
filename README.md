👋 Hi! My name is Phil. I am a Computer Science alumnus of the University of California, Irvine. :-) 

👀 My interests are focused on Web Development and Full Stack Development and are learning these via The Odin Project. I am always willing to learn something new! (at the cost of coffee)

Skills:

* 📚 On hand: C/C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git/GitHub (Version Control), MySQL, PostgreSQL

* 👩‍💻 Currently learning: More JavaScript, maybe some Tailwind CSS, Node.js, React, and many, many things!

Projects:

* 💭 Future/Prospective Projects:
  * 📄 Personal Portfolio
      * A website that exhibits my academic experience, prowess/skills, projects, and miscellaneous information.
  * ☕️🗺️ CoffeeLogs (tentative name)
      * My debut project... 🤫 Coming soon!

🤯 Fun facts about me:

* I love Charlie Burg and am among the top 0.1% of his listeners on Spotify (ask me about my music taste!)
* I keep a spreadsheet of all coffee shops I go to and rate them
* I've played all Pokemon games except Black 2/White 2 (actually playing right now!)
* I used to eat a bowl of tonkotsu ramen every week when I was still in community college (please don't do this, always stay hydrated!)
